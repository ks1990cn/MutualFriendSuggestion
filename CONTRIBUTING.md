1. Download VS2019 with .net development environment.
2. It is Console application, so just go to file -> open .sln and run!
3. We are planning this engine to be integrated with asp .net MVC and Entity framework, so we welcome ideas on how to make it more scalable, how we can do AI to it, how we
can make it more fast, clean code etc.
